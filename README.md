## Project Aim
This project generates a maze using a 2D array and allows the user to navigate through it in search of a target. The game demonstrates the use of complex data structures and includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for visualization.

## Source Files
- **MazeGenerator.java**: Generates a 2D maze with walls, paths, start, and target positions.
- **Player.java**: Handles player movement and position within the maze.
- **MazeGameGUI.java**: Displays the maze and handles graphical rendering of the game.

## Interface Functionality
- The maze is displayed as a grid where:
  - Walls are black cells.
  - Paths are white cells.
  - Start position is the top-left corner.
  - Target position is the bottom-right corner.
- Players can navigate the maze using arrow keys or buttons (to be implemented in future enhancements).

## How to Run
1. Compile the Java files:

2. Run the `MazeGameGUI` class:
